# Organizer

## Summary

This is basically a application that tries to marry concept of TODO app and a GTD philosophy, and it's ~~a cheeky rip-off~~ heavily inspired by 
Microsoft's [TO DO app](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/). 

I wrote it because I wanted an oldschool, simple desktop organizer application without accounts and all that online non-sense, and also it gave me a opportunity to try out pro tips form Robert Martin's book 'Clean Code', and learn JavaFX. Of course code's still a complete mess and GUI looks cheap at best, 
but I did my best and I see a progress! 

Everything's a WIP, so expect things to break, but overall it works surprisingly stable.
